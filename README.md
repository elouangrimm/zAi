# zAi - Bluesky AI Bot

Tag `@zai.elouan.xyz` on Bluesky to interact!

## Features

* **Responds to all mentions and replies** on Bluesky (via notifications)
* **Uses llama 4 maverick (or the model of your choice)** for all AI-powered text responses. Best part is that its completley free!
* **Thread-aware**: Replies with context of the entire conversation
* **Persistent cache**: Prevents duplicate replies (even if restarted)
* **Pretty Terminal UI**: has niceley formatted terminal info, mainly to run on your own machine!

## Setup

1. **Clone this repository**

2. **Create a `.env` file** with your credentials:

   ```env
   BLUESKY_HANDLE=your-bluesky-handle
   BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your-bluesky-password
   OPENROUTER_KEY=your-openrouter-api-key
   GPT_MODEL=openrouter-model-of-your-choice
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (requires Python 3.8+):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   *It will install the `websockets` and `requests` packages, as well as `atproto` and `python-dotenv` along with some others!*

4. **Run the bot**:

   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

   *Optional: change the default model by adding -m then your OpenRouter model name. Example: `python bot.py -m meta-llama/llama-4-maverick:free`*

## How It Works

* Listens for direct mentions and replies to your bot on Bluesky using the notifications API.
* Fetches the context of the whole thread for the most relevant and chaotic AI response.
* All replies are generated by llama 4 maverick (or annotehr model) via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (should be free for now).
* Prevents duplicate replies with a persistent log file (`processed_uris.txt`).

## Deployment

* This bot is platform-agnostic: you can run it on your computeron, your own server, Raspberry Pi, or deploy it on any service that supports persistent Python processes (like Railway, Fly.io, etc).
* Make sure your process can run continuously and has a persistent filesystem for the cache file.

## Notes

* Restarting the bot will not duplicate responses to old posts, as long as the `processed_uris.txt` file is kept.

## Example `.env`

```env
BLUESKY_HANDLE=your-handle.bsky.social
BLUESKY_PASSWORD=your-bluesky-app-password
OPENROUTER_KEY=sk-...your openrouter api key...
```
